=============================
     CostAlarm Scripts
=============================

These scripts are meant to be used with your account on costalarm.com

Once you sign up, please start with the costalarm-setup script.
It will guide you through the configuration process.

If you want to configure everything manually, all you have to do is to create
either /etc/costalarm/config or ~/.costalarmrc file with the following content:

AWS_USERNAME="...Your Amazon Web Services email here..."
AWS_PASSWORD="...Your Amazon Web Services password here..."
API_TOKEN="...Your CostAlarm.com API token here..."

You may also need to schedule the AWS statement import.
Simply invoke the costalarm-import script on regular basis.

Example for systems with cron installed:
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/costalarm-import
